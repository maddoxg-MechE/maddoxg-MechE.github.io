### Mission Concept Review
The Mission Concept Review (MCR) defines the mission’s objectives, architecture, and feasibility by outlining the scientific goals, operational approach, system trades, risks, and programmatic constraints, and serves as the first formal milestone to demonstrate that the proposed mission concept is viable and ready to proceed toward requirements definition.

### System Requirements Review
This Systems Requirements Review (SRR) defines the mission objectives, constraints, hazards, and subsystem-level requirements for the HELP mission to the Moon’s Compton Pit, establishing a clear technical baseline for a March 1, 2030 launch. It serves to transition the mission from concept development to requirements-driven design, identifying key risks, trade decisions, and remaining TBDs to be resolved in preparation for the upcoming SSR and MDR phases.

### Mission Definition Review
This document defines the programmatic, technical, and financial framework required to design, build, launch, and operate the HELP lunar rover mission. It establishes how risks are identified and mitigated, how systems are verified and validated, and how schedule and budget constraints are managed. Overall, it serves as the baseline planning and decision-making reference guiding the mission from design through closeout.

### Prelimenary Design Review
The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) assesses whether the mission’s preliminary design meets all applicable requirements and is mature enough to enter Phase C of the NASA Mission Life Cycle. The review verifies that technical designs, cost and schedule baselines, and risk mitigation strategies are credible and internally consistent. Approval at PDR establishes the basis for detailed design, fabrication, and integration.
