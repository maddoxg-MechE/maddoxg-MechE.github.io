### Fluent 2D Laminar Internal Flow Simulation: Poiseuille & Couette Cases
Simulated 2D laminar internal flow in ANSYS Fluent for Poiseuille, Couette, and combined pressure–shear configurations under steady incompressible conditions. Compared velocity fields, profile development, and maximum velocity locations to demonstrate the physical differences between pressure-driven and shear-driven channel flows.

### 2D Laminar Boundary Layer Over a Flat Plate 
Simulated 2D steady laminar airflow over a 1.0 m flat plate in ANSYS Fluent and visualized the developing boundary layer using velocity vectors and pressure contours. Extracted velocity profiles, boundary layer thickness, wall shear stress, skin friction, and drag, and compared Fluent results to classical flat-plate boundary layer theory.

### 2D CFD Analysis of Flow Around a Circular Cylinder: Inviscid, Laminar, and Turbulent Regimes
Simulated 2D flow around a circular cylinder in ANSYS Fluent under inviscid, laminar, and turbulent conditions to examine changes in flow structure and aerodynamic loading. Compared surface pressure, velocity distributions, and drag coefficients to assess the impact of viscosity and turbulence on separation and drag behavior

### Turbulent CFD Simulation of a Wind Tunnel With Test-Section Models 
Simulated a viscous turbulent wind tunnel flow in ANSYS Fluent (ideal-gas air) to achieve a 15 m/s test-section condition and evaluate pressure and velocity behavior throughout the tunnel. Added a 2D cylinder and thin flat plate model in the test section and extracted aerodynamic performance metrics—surface Cp, skin friction/wall shear, and drag coefficients—to quantify model-induced effects and overall test-section flow quality.
