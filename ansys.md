# CFD & ANSYS Fluent Simuulations


### 2D Laminar Boundary Layer Over a Flat Plate 
Simulated 2D steady laminar airflow over a 1.0 m flat plate in ANSYS Fluent and visualized the developing boundary layer using velocity vectors and pressure contours. Extracted velocity profiles, boundary layer thickness, wall shear stress, skin friction, and drag, and compared Fluent results to classical flat-plate boundary layer theory.

### Matlab Project: Solving Non-Linear Equations Using Newton-Raphson
Applies the Newton–Raphson method to solve a system of nonlinear equations arising from finite-difference heat conduction modeling. MATLAB was used to compute the Jacobian numerically, enforce convergence criteria, and analyze the resulting temperature distribution.

### Matlab Project: Solving Systems of Equations using the Gauss-Seidel SOR algorithm
Implements the Gauss–Seidel method with Successive Over-Relaxation in MATLAB to solve a large system of linear equations arising from a heat transfer problem. Convergence behavior and solver efficiency were evaluated by analyzing residual norms and iteration counts across multiple relaxation parameters.

### Matlab Project: Solving Systems of Equations using Gauss Elimination
Uses the Gauss Elimination method in MATLAB to solve a large system of linear equations read from external data files. Solution accuracy and numerical stability were assessed through residual analysis, comparison with MATLAB’s linear solver, and evaluation of matrix diagonal dominance.
