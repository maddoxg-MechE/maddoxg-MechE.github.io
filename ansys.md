# CFD & ANSYS Fluent Simuulations


### Fluent 2D Laminar Internal Flow Simulation: Poiseuille & Couette Cases
Simulated 2D laminar internal flow in ANSYS Fluent for Poiseuille, Couette, and combined pressure–shear configurations under steady incompressible conditions. Compared velocity fields, profile development, and maximum velocity locations to demonstrate the physical differences between pressure-driven and shear-driven channel flows.

### ### 2D Laminar Boundary Layer Over a Flat Plate 
Simulated 2D steady laminar airflow over a 1.0 m flat plate in ANSYS Fluent and visualized the developing boundary layer using velocity vectors and pressure contours. Extracted velocity profiles, boundary layer thickness, wall shear stress, skin friction, and drag, and compared Fluent results to classical flat-plate boundary layer theory.

### Matlab Project: Solving Systems of Equations using the Gauss-Seidel SOR algorithm
Implements the Gauss–Seidel method with Successive Over-Relaxation in MATLAB to solve a large system of linear equations arising from a heat transfer problem. Convergence behavior and solver efficiency were evaluated by analyzing residual norms and iteration counts across multiple relaxation parameters.

### Matlab Project: Solving Systems of Equations using Gauss Elimination
Uses the Gauss Elimination method in MATLAB to solve a large system of linear equations read from external data files. Solution accuracy and numerical stability were assessed through residual analysis, comparison with MATLAB’s linear solver, and evaluation of matrix diagonal dominance.
