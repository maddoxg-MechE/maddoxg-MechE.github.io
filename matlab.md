# MATLAB & Data Analysis


### MatLab Project: Linear Least Squares
Utilizes least-squares polynomial regression to experimental data using MATLAB. Linear, quadratic, and seventh-order models were developed and evaluated using statistical error metrics and graphical analysis.

### Matlab Project: Solving Non-Linear Equations Using Newton-Raphson
Applies the Newton–Raphson method to solve a system of nonlinear equations arising from finite-difference heat conduction modeling. MATLAB was used to compute the Jacobian numerically, enforce convergence criteria, and analyze the resulting temperature distribution.

### Matlab Project: Solving Systems of Equations using the Gauss-Seidel SOR algorithm
Implements the Gauss–Seidel method with Successive Over-Relaxation in MATLAB to solve a large system of linear equations arising from a heat transfer problem. Convergence behavior and solver efficiency were evaluated by analyzing residual norms and iteration counts across multiple relaxation parameters.
