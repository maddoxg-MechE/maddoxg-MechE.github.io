# MATLAB & Data Analysis


### MatLab Project: Linear Least Squares
Utilizes least-squares polynomial regression to experimental data using MATLAB. Linear, quadratic, and seventh-order models were developed and evaluated using statistical error metrics and graphical analysis.

### Matlab Project: Solving Non-Linear Equations Using Newton-Raphson
Applies the Newton–Raphson method to solve a system of nonlinear equations arising from finite-difference heat conduction modeling. MATLAB was used to compute the Jacobian numerically, enforce convergence criteria, and analyze the resulting temperature distribution.

### Matlab Project: Solving Systems of Equations using the Gauss-Seidel SOR algorithm
Implements the Gauss–Seidel method with Successive Over-Relaxation in MATLAB to solve a large system of linear equations arising from a heat transfer problem. Convergence behavior and solver efficiency were evaluated by analyzing residual norms and iteration counts across multiple relaxation parameters.

### Matlab Project: Solving Systems of Equations using Gauss Elimination
Uses the Gauss Elimination method in MATLAB to solve a large system of linear equations read from external data files. Solution accuracy and numerical stability were assessed through residual analysis, comparison with MATLAB’s linear solver, and evaluation of matrix diagonal dominance.

### Matlab Project: Root Solving Using Newton-Raphson and Secant Method – finding the friction factor in a pipe
Applies the Newton–Raphson and Secant methods to solve the Colebrook equation for the friction factor in turbulent pipe flow. MATLAB was used to compute the friction factor, evaluate head loss, and compare convergence behavior between the two numerical root-finding methods.
