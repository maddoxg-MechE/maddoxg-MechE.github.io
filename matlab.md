# MATLAB & Data Analysis

Projects involving numerical methods, simulations, and signal processing.

### MatLab Project: Linear Least Squares
Utilizes least-squares polynomial regression to experimental data using MATLAB. Linear, quadratic, and seventh-order models were developed and evaluated using statistical error metrics and graphical analysis.

## Matlab Project: Solving Non-Linear Equations Using Newton-Raphson
Applies the Newton–Raphson method to solve a system of nonlinear equations arising from finite-difference heat conduction modeling. MATLAB was used to compute the Jacobian numerically, enforce convergence criteria, and analyze the resulting temperature distribution.
