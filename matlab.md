### Matlab Project: Solving Non-Linear Equations Using Newton-Raphson
Applies the Newton–Raphson method to solve a system of nonlinear equations arising from finite-difference heat conduction modeling. MATLAB was used to compute the Jacobian numerically, enforce convergence criteria, and analyze the resulting temperature distribution.

### Matlab Project: Solving Systems of Equations using the Gauss-Seidel SOR algorithm
Implements the Gauss–Seidel method with Successive Over-Relaxation in MATLAB to solve a large system of linear equations arising from a heat transfer problem. Convergence behavior and solver efficiency were evaluated by analyzing residual norms and iteration counts across multiple relaxation parameters.

### Matlab Project: Root Solving Using Newton-Raphson and Secant Method – finding the friction factor in a pipe
Applies the Newton–Raphson and Secant methods to solve the Colebrook equation for the friction factor in turbulent pipe flow. MATLAB was used to compute the friction factor, evaluate head loss, and compare convergence behavior between the two numerical root-finding methods.

### Matlab Project: Finite Difference and why you cannot take the limit ∆x → 0 on the computer.
Built a MATLAB script to compare forward, backward, and central finite-difference derivative approximations at x=0.75 over a wide range of step sizes. Verified accuracy against the exact derivative, visualized error trends on log–log plots, and repeated the analysis in single precision to highlight floating-point limitations and machine epsilon effects.

### Matlab Project: Gauss Quadratures
Built a MATLAB solver using 5-point Gauss–Legendre quadrature to compute the nonlinear period of a simple pendulum as a function of initial angle. Validated the integration routine against an analytical benchmark and evaluated the period using one vs. two quadrature intervals to study accuracy.

### Matlab Project: 1st order ODE Solver for circuit
Simulated the transient voltage decay of an RC circuit by solving a first-order ODE in MATLAB. Compared Euler’s method at multiple time steps with the exact solution and with ode45 under different tolerances to study accuracy, stability, and step-size effects.

### Matlab Project: Solution of 2nd order Non-linear ODE from Pendulum
Modeled a nonlinear pendulum in MATLAB by combining adaptive quadrature (quadgk) for period prediction with ode45 for time-domain simulation ofθ(t) and θ˙(t). Compared solutions across solver tolerances and drag conditions using interpolated point evaluations, time-history plots, and phase-space (Poincaré) maps to validate accuracy and characterize damping effects.
