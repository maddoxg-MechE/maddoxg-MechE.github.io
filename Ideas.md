# IDEAS Competition: Cable Stayed Bridge
## Project Report

This project investigated the structural behavior and design limits of cable stayed bridges using fundamental statics principles. A scaled physical model was designed, constructed, and analyzed to better understand how forces are distributed through the deck, cables, and towers. By applying equilibrium equations, cable tensions and reaction forces were calculated to establish safe load limits for each structural component.

To validate the theoretical analysis, a physical bridge model was built using wood, nylon cables, and custom 3D printed components. The model was tested under various loading conditions to observe how different weight distributions affected stability. Distributed loads resulted in improved structural performance and reduced stress in individual cables, while concentrated loads led to cable failure at lower total weights. These observations closely matched the calculated results and reinforced the importance of proper load distribution in cable stayed bridge design.

Overall, the project demonstrated how statics plays a critical role in predicting structural behavior and preventing failure. The close agreement between analytical calculations and experimental results confirmed the validity of the design approach. This study highlights how careful material selection, accurate force analysis, and controlled testing can improve the safety and reliability of real world bridge structures.
