# L'Space Mission Concept Review
## Project Report

Contributed to the Mission Concept Review (MCR) for the Habitability Explorer for Lunar Pits (HELP), a proposed robotic mission designed to assess lunar pits as potential sites for long-term human habitation. The mission targets the Compton Pit and focuses on evaluating thermal stability, radiation shielding, structural integrity, and in situ resource availability within and around the pit. A comprehensive science traceability matrix was developed to link mission objectives to measurable parameters, including mineral composition, water and hydroxyl presence, temperature variation, radiation levels, and cave geometry.

The mission architecture consists of a lander and rover system capable of descending a 20° entrance ramp and operating in low-light, rugged terrain. Key subsystems and instruments—including NIRVSS, LIBS, APXS, RAD, TRIDENT, and lidar-based cave-mapping systems—were selected to support ISRU assessment, environmental characterization, and hazard identification. A detailed trade study compared multiple lunar pit candidates, ultimately selecting Compton Pit based on accessibility, thermal behavior, geological structure, and ice potential. Environmental hazards such as radiation exposure, extreme temperatures, regolith abrasion, communication latency, and power constraints were analyzed to inform system design and operational planning.

Programmatic elements including team organization, democratic decision-making processes, cost estimation, and mission scheduling were developed in alignment with NASA’s mission life cycle. A rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimate (~$130M) and a multi-phase schedule leading to a March 2030 launch were produced using analog missions such as Chandrayaan-3, BRAILLE, and Lucy. The mission concept demonstrates technical feasibility within budget and schedule constraints while providing high scientific and human-exploration value by advancing knowledge of lunar subsurface environments as potential natural habitats.
