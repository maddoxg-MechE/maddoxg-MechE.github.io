# L'Space Mission Concept Review
## Project Report

With a target launch date of March 1, 2030, the Habitability Explorer for Lunar Pits (HELP) mission investigates the Compton Pit as a potential thermally stable environment for future lunar habitation. The rover concept is designed to collect spectral signatures related to oxygen, water/hydroxyl, and other in situ resources while also characterizing pit geometry, terrain, accessibility, and structural hazards to support safe long-duration human operations. This Mission Concept Review (MCR) establishes the initial mission rationale and outlines key environmental hazards, system evaluation criteria, concept of operations, and programmatics including team organization, cost, and schedule estimates.

This mission concept is intended to serve as a foundation for continued systems development and requirements definition. With additional time and iteration, the robotic architecture would be further refined, including subsystem selection, instrumentation trades, and closure of TBD items in the Science Traceability Matrix. Hazard analysis and risk coverage would be expanded to ensure completeness, and team roles/processes would be formalized to strengthen coordination and decision-making. These updates will be incorporated as the project approaches the System Requirements Review (SSR), where the MCR baseline will be matured into defined system requirements and performance expectations.
