# 2D Laminar Boundary Layer Over a Flat Plate (ANSYS Fluent)
## Project Report

Performed a 2D steady laminar CFD simulation in ANSYS Fluent to model airflow over a thin flat plate and resolve boundary-layer development along the surface. Generated velocity vector fields and pressure contours with a focused boundary-layer view, then extracted velocity profiles at x = 0.35m and x = 0.75m to estimate boundary-layer thickness from the CFD results. Computed wall shear stress and local skin-friction coefficient Cf(x) along the plate and compared the Fluent predictions against classical laminar flat-plate theory on the same plots. Finally, evaluated the overall drag coefficient Cd	​from Fluent and compared it to the theoretical value in a clear table to validate the simulation accuracy.
