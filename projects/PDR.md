# Preliminary Design Review

## Project Report

The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) is conducted to evaluate the maturity and consistency of the mission’s preliminary design and to determine whether the project is prepared to transition from Formulation into Phase C of the NASA Mission Life Cycle. The review assesses compliance with applicable requirements and verifies that the technical approach, cost, and schedule baselines are sufficiently developed to enable mission success with acceptable risk. Approval at PDR establishes the foundation for proceeding into detailed design, fabrication, integration, and verification.

The PDR documents the integrated spacecraft architecture and demonstrates that all major subsystems have been defined at a preliminary level, with clear requirements, interfaces, redundancy strategies, and verification plans. This includes confirmation that system-level risks have been identified and mitigated, that design trades have been resolved, and that remaining technical uncertainties have been reduced to an acceptable level prior to Phase C.

As part of this effort, particular development and analysis contributions were made to the Power Subsystem and Thermal Control Subsystem, ensuring that energy generation, storage, distribution, and autonomous thermal regulation concepts were technically sound and properly integrated within the overall system design. These subsystem contributions support the PDR objective by demonstrating subsystem readiness, traceability to mission requirements, and compatibility with the spacecraft’s operational and environmental constraints.
