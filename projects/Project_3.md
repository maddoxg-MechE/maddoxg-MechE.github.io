# Matlab Project: Solving Systems of Equations using Gauss Elimination

## Project Report

### This project involved developing a MATLAB implementation of the Gauss Elimination method to solve a large system of linear equations with 120 unknowns. The coefficient matrix and right-hand side vector were read directly from external data files, emphasizing proper data handling and numerical workflow rather than manual input. The solver’s accuracy was evaluated by computing the infinity norm of the residual and comparing the numerical solution against MATLAB’s built-in linsolve routine. In addition, a diagnostic subroutine was developed to automatically assess whether the coefficient matrix was diagonally dominant, providing insight into numerical stability and whether pivoting would be appropriate for solving the system. The project reinforced fundamental concepts in linear algebra, numerical accuracy, and algorithm verification.
