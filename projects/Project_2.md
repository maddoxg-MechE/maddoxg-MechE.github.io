# Matlab Project: Solving Systems of Equations using Gauss Elimination

## Project Report

### This project focused on solving nonlinear equations using the Newton–Raphson and Secant methods to determine the Darcy friction factor in pipe flow. The friction factor was obtained by numerically solving the Colebrook equation, a transcendental relation commonly used in fluid mechanics to model pressure losses in turbulent pipe flow. MATLAB routines were developed for both methods, including iterative convergence tracking and residual evaluation at each step. The computed friction factor was then used to calculate head loss in a long pipe, and the convergence behavior, accuracy, and efficiency of the Newton–Raphson and Secant methods were compared through iteration histories and residual plots.
