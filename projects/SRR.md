# System Requirements Review
## Project Report

The SRR establishes the HELP mission baseline for a March 1, 2030 launch to the Moon’s Compton Pit, defining objectives, constraints, hazards, system requirements, and preliminary cost and schedule to assess habitability, ISRU potential, and environmental conditions. It transitions the mission from concept to a requirements-driven framework while identifying TBDs to be resolved before SSR and MDR.

Subsystem requirements are defined across mechanical, electrical, thermal, CDH, and payload domains. Mechanical design focuses on mass, volume, and mobility for pit access, with detailed designs deferred. The electrical and power subsystem, which I led, is relatively mature and outlines a solar-based architecture with tracking panels, solid-state battery storage, redundancy, autonomy, and low-power modes, supported by trade studies favoring solid-state batteries for safety and performance.

The thermal management subsystem, also under my lead role, is a key emphasis and defines an autonomous, redundant active–passive system to maintain stable internal temperatures in extreme lunar surface and cave environments. This includes MLI and reflective coatings, Kapton heaters, heat pipes, fluid loops, radiators, and thermoelectric coolers, with trade studies justifying component selection.
