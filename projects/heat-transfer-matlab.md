# MatLab Project: Linear Least Squares

## Project Report

## This project involved applying least-squares regression techniques to experimental data using MATLAB. Given a set of (x,y) data pairs provided in external data files, the objective was to model the relationship between the variables using polynomial curve fitting and evaluate the quality and accuracy of each model. Linear, quadratic, and seventh-order polynomial least-squares fits were generated for the data. Each model was analyzed by evaluating the fitted function at a specified point using the standard error, plotting the fitted curves alongside the original data over a defined domain, and computing statistical performance metrics including the coefficient of determination (R^2) and the standard error. The results were used to compare model accuracy, overfitting behavior, and predictive capability across different polynomial orders.
MATLAB was used to import the data, perform the regression analysis, generate plots, and compute error statistics. The final deliverables included the MATLAB source code, graphical output, and numerical results documenting the performance of each polynomial fit.
