# Fluent 2D Laminar Internal Flow Simulation: Poiseuille & Couette Cases
## Project Report

Conducted 2D steady, laminar, incompressible CFD simulations in ANSYS Fluent to analyze internal channel flow under three driving mechanisms: pressure-driven (Poiseuille flow), shear-driven (Couette flow), and a combined pressure–shear configuration. Geometry dimensions were selected to maintain laminar conditions with Reynolds numbers below 2500, and fluid properties were chosen accordingly. For each case, velocity contours and vector fields were generated, velocity profiles were extracted at the channel midpoint and outlet, and the location and magnitude of the maximum velocity were identified and tabulated. Input parameters and resulting Reynolds numbers were documented, and the flow behavior across cases was compared to highlight how pressure gradients and moving boundaries influence internal laminar flow development.
