# 2D Laminar Boundary Layer Over a Flat Plate (ANSYS Fluent)
## Project Report

Modeled laminar, steady, incompressible flow over a thin flat plate (L = 1.0 m) in ANSYS Fluent. Generated pressure and velocity-vector contours and zoomed into the near-wall region to capture boundary-layer development. Quantitatively evaluated boundary-layer behavior by exporting velocity profiles at x = 0.35m and x = 0.75m and estimating boundary-layer thickness from the profiles, then comparing those values against theoretical laminar flat-plate predictions. Computed wall shear stress and skin-friction coefficient distributions along the plate and overlaid Fluent and theoretical curves to assess agreement and trends. Finally, obtained the plate drag coefficient from Fluent force reports and compared the CFD-based drag coefficient to the theoretical value in tabulated form.
