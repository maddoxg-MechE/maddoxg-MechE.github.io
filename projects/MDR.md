# L'Space Mission Definition Review
## Project Report

This document presents a comprehensive mission-level plan for the HELP lunar rover, detailing how organizational structure, risk management, verification and validation, manufacturing and procurement, scheduling, and budgeting collectively support a successful March 1, 2030 launch. A major focus is placed on identifying and mitigating technical, programmatic, and environmental risks through RIDM and CRM processes, supported by FMEA, planetary protection compliance, and personnel safety protocols. 

Within the engineering scope, the Power and Thermal subsystems emerge as mission-critical drivers, as they are directly impacted by lunar dust, extreme temperature swings, radiation exposure, and prolonged periods of darkness. Power system reliability is addressed through redundant solar generation, advanced energy storage, dust-mitigation technologies, and radiation shielding, while the Thermal system relies on integrated heaters, radiators, insulation (MLI), and fluid loops to maintain operable temperatures across all subsystems. These two systems are tightly coupled with mechanical, CDH, and payload performance, making them central to risk reduction, TRL maturation, cost estimation, and schedule confidence. The document also establishes a realistic, phased schedule and a descoped yet margin-protected budget, ensuring that high-risk systems—particularly thermal and electrical—have sufficient resources, testing time, and contingency to support mission success.
