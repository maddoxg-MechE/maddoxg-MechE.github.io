# L'Space Mission Definition Review
## Project Report

This document presents a comprehensive mission-level overview of the HELP lunar rover, defining how mission organization, risk management, verification and validation, manufacturing, scheduling, and budgeting collectively support a March 1, 2030 launch. It outlines team roles across engineering, science, programmatics, outreach, and mission assurance, while establishing clear decision-making authority and coordination strategies. Risk-Informed Decision Making (RIDM), Continuous Risk Management (CRM), and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) are used throughout the mission life cycle to identify, prioritize, and mitigate technical, safety, cost, and schedule risks.

The Power and Thermal subsystems are highlighted as critical drivers of mission success due to the Moon’s extreme environmental conditions. The power system is designed to operate through prolonged darkness, radiation exposure, and lunar dust accumulation using redundant solar generation, solid-state batteries, autonomous power management, and dust-mitigation technologies. Closely integrated with this, the thermal system addresses extreme temperature swings through active heaters, insulation, radiators, fluid loops, and dust-resistant designs to maintain safe operating conditions for electronics, payloads, and power hardware. Failures in either subsystem pose mission-wide risks, making them central to system design, testing, and risk mitigation.

Programmatically, the mission schedule and budget are structured using heritage missions as analogs, allowing sufficient time for subsystem maturation, manufacturing, and testing, with particular emphasis on electrical and thermal integration. Budget margins, phased staffing plans, and supplier redundancy ensure flexibility in addressing uncertainties while maintaining compliance with cost and schedule constraints. Overall, the document serves as a unified mission framework that aligns technical design—especially power and thermal systems—with disciplined programmatic planning to enable reliable lunar exploration and future habitation studies.
