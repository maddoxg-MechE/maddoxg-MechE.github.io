# Matlab Project: Gauss Quadratures

## Project Report

### Implemented a 5-point Gauss–Legendre quadrature routine in MATLAB to numerically evaluate the nonlinear period of a simple pendulum, where the period depends on the initial release angle through the parameter k Verified the quadrature implementation by integrating a test function with a known analytical solution, then computed the pendulum period for L = 7.5m and g = 9.81m/s^2 using both a single integration interval [0,𝜋/2] and a two-interval split [0,𝜋/4] + [π/4,π/2]. Compared the results to assess how interval subdivision affects numerical accuracy and reported values to eight decimal places.
