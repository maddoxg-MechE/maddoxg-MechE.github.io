# Turbulent CFD Simulation of a Wind Tunnel With Test-Section Models in ANSYS Fluent
## Project Report

Modeled a full wind tunnel geometry in ANSYS Fluent under viscous turbulent flow conditions using air as an ideal gas, targeting a test-section velocity of 15 m/s by determining the appropriate inlet condition at the contraction entrance. Generated contour plots of static pressure, velocity magnitude, total pressure, and dynamic pressure across the tunnel and visualized streamline patterns to assess flow development through the contraction, test section, and diffuser. Extracted centerline distributions of pressure, velocity, total pressure, and dynamic pressure to quantify losses and acceleration, and evaluated cross-sectional uniformity by plotting vertical profiles of velocity, dynamic pressure, and total pressure at the test-section center. Extended the simulation by inserting a scaled 2D cylinder and a thin flat plate into the test section, producing zoomed-in flow/pressure contours and surface performance metrics including Cp distributions, wall shear stress, skin-friction coefficient trends, and drag coefficients for each model.
