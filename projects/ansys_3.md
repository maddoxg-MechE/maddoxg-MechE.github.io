# 2D CFD Analysis of Flow Around a Circular Cylinder: Inviscid, Laminar, and Turbulent Regimes
## Project Report

Performed 2D CFD simulations of flow over a circular cylinder (D = 1 m) in ANSYS Fluent across three regimes: inviscid, viscous laminar, and viscous turbulent. Freestream velocity was selected to achieve the appropriate Reynolds-number ranges, using 5 m/s for the inviscid case and adjusting velocities for laminar vs. turbulent behavior with respect to the critical Reynolds number criterion. For each case, post-processed velocity contours, streamlines, and pressure contours to visualize the flow field and compare how viscosity and turbulence modeling affect separation behavior and wake structure. Extracted surface distributions of velocity magnitude and pressure coefficient Cp and overlaid the three cases on single comparison plots. Calculated drag coefficients for all three simulations, tabulated the results, and compared trends across inviscid, laminar, and turbulent models to discuss how viscous effects and turbulence influence drag.
