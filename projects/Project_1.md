# Matlab Project: Finite Difference and why you cannot take the limit    ∆x → 0 on the computer.

## Project Report

### Implemented forward, backward, and central finite-difference schemes in MATLAB to approximate the first derivative of a given function at 𝑥 = 0.75across step sizes     spanning 10^-1 down to 10^-20. Computed the exact derivative for reference, quantified numerical error for each method, and organized results into tables and log–log error plots to study truncation error versus round-off error and identify the step-size range that produces the most accurate estimates. Repeated the full analysis in single precision and evaluated machine epsilon for both default double precision and single precision to connect floating-point limits to the observed error behavior.
