# Matlab Project: Solving Non-Linear Equations Using Newton-Raphson

## Project Report

### This project focused on developing a MATLAB implementation of the Gauss–Seidel iterative method with Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) to solve large systems of linear equations. The system arose from a finite-difference discretization of heat transfer in a triangular fin, producing a sparse linear system with 201 unknown nodal temperatures. The solver was validated using a smaller test system before being applied to the full problem. Convergence behavior was analyzed using both iterative and residual norm criteria, and the impact of varying the relaxation parameter was studied by comparing residual convergence histories and iteration counts. The results demonstrated how optimal relaxation parameters significantly improve convergence efficiency for large-scale numerical systems.
